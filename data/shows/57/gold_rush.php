	Laurel's Arabian Theatre had its grand opening day in April 1927.  It 
	operated as a movie house for 50 years, and then after closing, Laurel 
	Little Theatre bought the building and saved it to become our own 
	performing arts theatre.

	To celebrate the 91st Birthday of the last remaining downtown movie 
	palace, LLT will have a one-night-only 1920's costume party (costumes 
    optional) showing Charlie Chaplin's masterful silent movie comedy 
    <span class='showTitle'>THE GOLD RUSH</span> on April 7th at 730PM.
    </p>

    <p>
	Chaplin's hilariously famous "Little Tramp" is a gold prospector that 
	becomes trapped in a deserted cabin during a snow storm, and the movie
	features the comedian's most beloved bits and silliest moments. 
    </p>

    <p>
	It received several Academy Award nominations, and itâ€™s on the American 
	Film Institute's "100 Greatest Movies" list. <span class='showTitle'>THE GOLD RUSH</span> was the number one movie 
	of the 1926-27 movie season, and the film is 
	still in the Top Five of the highest-grossing silent films of all time.
    </p>

    <p>
	Admission is free for LLT season ticket holders (no punch will be 
	taken, you just show your season ticket) - or single admission is 
	$10 for adults and $5 for students.   
    </p>

    <p>
	The movie runs just an hour and a half, and this silent film features a 
	lush musical score.  Wear your favorite 1920's look if you'd like - 
	and join in.  WHAT A FUN NIGHT!
    </p>

    <p>
	LLT's reservation line only answers the week of each show - 24 hours a day at <?php print $_SESSION['llt_phone']?>.
