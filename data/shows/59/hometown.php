       In light of the health concerns of close crowds in the public, weâ€™ve had to cancel our viewing of 
       HOME TOWN this coming Monday.  But watch it on HGTV at 8pm - and look for the scenes that 
       were filmed in our Arabian Theatre.
       <br /><br />
<!--       
        Monday, March 16, at 8pm, we'll have a live broadcast at the theatre of that week's episode of HOME TOWN.  
        It includes a segment recently filmed inside our Arabian Theatre that features LLT alumni actress Catherine
        Nowicki.  Doors will open at 7:15pm for the 8pm broadcast.
        <span style="color:#ffc832;font-weight:bold">FREE ADMISSION, first come on seating.</span>
