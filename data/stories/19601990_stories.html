<p class="normal">
    At 79 he hasn't lost any of the savvy which he had used as a youth to pad the life he would have to live 
    after the 40s, the 50s, and those precious years that come later.
     <br /><br />
     Though if you pressed him for an answer......Why?  Why this fine, easy, comfortable life?
     <br /><br />
     Well, he might have denied that it was mental wizardry and charged it off to fate, the breaks or 
     whatever the ingredient that make the otherwise complicated lives of men a little smoother.
     <br /><br />
     But he wasn't asked, therefore nothing was explained.
     <br /><br />
     This man, W. S. (Sank) Taylor of Laurel, whose record stands with the veterans of the state's movie 
     house operators, might have explained had one asked him, that it was a combination of more sweat than
     brains, more determination than circumstances of his senior years.
     <br /><br />
     Well, to this he might have said, well, and got no farther.  But, then, after all, isn't this 
     circumstantial anyway?
     <br /><br />
     Then he started to call back the years of his youth, because it was there that it all began in 1907.
     <br /><br />
     "When they turned the bull loose," he continued, "he charged out into the ring and then finally 
     he filled up the whole screen."
     <br /><br />
     Taylor paused a moment, reflecting, "I lost every boy in the house."  This was the year 1907 and Taylor 
     had opened the first movie house in Laurel. Ed Sullivan wasn't there, but if he had been, he would have 
     predicted that it was going to be a "really biiig shou."
     <br /><br />
     "It was a reel about a bull fight in Mexico and it lasted a breath-taking seven minutes."
     <br /><br />
     To the John Public of that day, the whole thing was as new as a whisper always is.  There were no newspapers
     in those days, he said, so he went all over town advertising the event.
     <br /><br />
     "I used a buggy and a megaphone.  That night when the movie opened, there were more people standing 
     outside than there were inside."
     <br /><br />
     Counting the boys who sat in rows between the seats, there were 265 people in the building that night.
     Taylor had broken the ice and a new heard-about, but for the most part unseen entertainment had come to town
     and Taylor was going to make it his oyster.
     <br /><br />
     But, if it hadn't been for Taylor's purchase of a movie projector, probably the first in Laurel at the time, 
     the public might have had to wait a while.
     <br /><br />
     Taylor says he bought a projector from a Meridian firm and that this firm had taken him back to Meridian 
     to show him a movie house that had opened there.
     <br /><br />
     "When I came back to Laurel, I rented a building next to the O'Ferrell Building and hung a sheet on 
     the wall."  Seventy feet to the rear sat the mysterious machine that would give to the world Valentino and
     all the Pearl Whites and Charlie Chaplins that have since inscribed their names in moviedom.
     <br /><br />
     In the years that followed, Taylor would open several movie houses and he would see himself voted out 
     of a fourth-share partnership in the still existent Strand Theatre because "they wanted a high-tone man 
     to run it."  He said his wearing shoes with run-down heels helped prevent him from owning a share in one
     of the state's finest theatres at that time.
     <br /><br />
     It cost its subscribers a high figure, Taylor said.  The year was 1919 and the cost to the subscribers
     was $174,000.  It closed six months later, however.  Poor projectormanship and admission prices of 25
     cents and 50 cents were influential in its collapse, Taylor said.  He was only charging 10 and 20 cents
     at his own theater.

        <span class="showtitle">WHERE IS LAUREL LITTLE THEATRE?
            <br />By Marda Burton for the Laurel Leader-Call&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;October 17, 1968
        </span>
    </strong>
    <br /><br />
  Do you know where the Laurel Little Theatre is?  Evidently a lot of people do not know.  Last summer a Meridian couple 
  in Laurel for the Mississippi Theatre Association convention searched diligently for two hours and never found LLT even 
  though they asked people on the streets and stopped at all the service stations to ask.  No one knew.  When we met them 
  at the after-theatre party, they were mad at themselves for not staying with the crowd, mad at LLT for not marking the 
  building, and mad at Laurelites for not knowing the location of their newest cultural facility.
  <br /><br />
  But LLT is not lost.  It is attached to (but not part of) the Civic Center on South Magnolia Street.  It's next-door 
  neighbors are a service station and Happy Times School on the back and the Chamber of Commerce office and a cafe on the 
  front.  And the minute you step inside, you feel that you are in much more glamorous surroundings and something quite 
  special is going to happen.  It usually does.
  <br /><br />
  As to where the Little Theatre is financially...this week the membership drive began under the direction of Peggy 
  Deavours and one thousand members is the goal.  This should be a breeze for the membership team because this year 
  Laurelites should be beating down the doors to see the three outstanding presentations for this season, and you are 
  urged to send in your checks as soon as possible.
  <br /><br />
  Which brings us to where LLT is artistically.  It has definitely taken a giant step in the right direction.  With two 
  fresh-from-Broadway offerings ("The Apple Tree" and "Cactus Flower") and a Tennessee Williams ("Glass Menagerie") for 
  the three regular productions, and with some of the extras that President Ruth Tomlinson is planning as bonuses for 
  members, there will be much more going on at the Playhouse than ever before.
  <br /><br />
  The extras are only in the planning stages and I am not supposed to announce them, but (I can't resist a hint) would you 
  believe excerpts from Shakespeare?  An evening of musical comedy?  More poetry readings like the quite excellent Carl 
  Sandburg program at the museum recently?  A visiting little theatre with an outstanding play?  There are enough plans 
  afoot to make your $6 this year worth more than it has a right to be...and there is enough talent, enthusiasm and 
  imagination wrapped up into that one woman (Ruth Tomlinson) to bring several seasons of ambitious plans to fruition.
  <br /><br />
  And one exciting undertaking is beginning already on Monday, October 21 at 7 p.m. at the LLT Playhouse.  A director's 
  workshop instructed by Lawrence Zimmer of the University of Southern Mississippi Theatre Department will run for four 
  Monday nights - and directors, would-be directors and theatre-buffs from all over South Mississippi are expected to 
  attend.
  <br /><br />
  It is especially hoped that high school dramatic coaches and those who find themselves responsible for directing high 
  school plays will take advantage of this free workshop, which is made available through Title I funds for the Arts.  It 
  is not really necessary that you intend to direct plays to attend the workshop, for all phases of the theatre game will 
  be covered, from backstage to lobby.  And it is not necessary that you be a member of LLT to attend and take part.
  <br /><br />
  As to where LLT is in its regular season..."Glass Menagerie" tryouts will be coming up before the month is out (the 
  books are ordered and on the way) for a pre-Thanksgiving production date.  Page Harris is ramrodding this one and 
  everyone who is interested in working on it (backstage or front stage) be sure to turn up for the tryouts.
  <br /><br />
  As to where the Little Theatre is in the mainstream of community life...it is firmly entrenched.  After seven years in 
  operation, it is a significant part of Laurel and the cultural life of the area.
  <br /><br />
  So...now you know where Laurel Little Theatre is.  From its location on South Magnolia it is steaming ahead with 
  exciting plans and a stimulation season of theatre for the enjoyment of the entire community.  Its success, however, 
  depends upon community support and memberships, not to mention interest and enthusiasm.  And when you find LLT, you win 
  a prize...a prize of fun, relaxation, entertainment and enlightenment.  Now don't get lost!

        <span class="showtitle">ONCE UPON A TIME
            <br />By Marda Burton for the Laurel Leader-Call&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;February 15, 1969
        </span>
    </strong>
    <br /><br />
  Once upon a time there was a vaudeville theatre in Laurel.  It was built in 1920.  It was on Central Avenue and it was 
  called The Strand.  It is still there.
  <br /><br />
  The Strand has played a large part in the cultural life of our city.  There were years and years of stage shows, plays, 
  recitals, minstrels and concerts.  And there were movies, movies and more movies, slowly declining in quality as the 
  theatre trappings became shabbier and shabbier.  Its original decorations, all in the best taste of the time, rococo 
  plaster molding, ornate lighting fixtures, heavy draperies, luxurious box seats, slowly but surely gave in to the 
  insatiable demands of time; and as they became worn through the years the more discrimination clientele moved to the 
  newer Arabian around the next corner, which was owned by the same Strand Amusement Company and which now had the 
  first-run features.
  <br /><br />
  The Strand had a brief return to glory in the form of some renovation and modernizing just about three years ago, when 
  it was purchased for use as a deluxe movie theatre for extra special feature films.  Its name was changed to the Royal, 
  but nobody ever called it that.  It was still The Strand.  Somehow, though, this brief fling came to naught and now it  
  is abandoned, musty and dark with a big "For Sale" on its marquee where the names of the great stars once blazed.
  <br /><br />
  But recently, a few nostalgic individuals took flashlights in hand, wrapped themselves warmly in heavy coats and 
  invaded the pitch black and grave-silent environs.  Half thinking the old theatre ghosts might not welcome visitors, we 
  wondered if the building would act hostile to the modern intruders - rodents and broken legs being uppermost on our 
  minds; but, on the contrary, we felt excited, happy and rather welcome as our flashlight beams darted hither and yon, 
  resting first on a hanging chandelier, then a plaster column, then on to draped and dusty arches, which once defined 
  the elegant and erstwhile box seats.  If ghosts were there, they were hospitable ones.
  <br /><br />
  When our beams picked up the old front drop, there they stopped, for we had made a discovery.  With avid interest we 
  saw that this magnificent trompe l'oiel curtained desert scene had superimposed over it scrolled boxes and medallions 
  printed with legends like "Pearson's Ice Cream - Best Because It's Pure"; "Buick Accessories and Parts - Myer Shelby"; 
  "Howard E. Greer - Modern Plumbing and Heating - Edison Lamp Globes", "Laurel Furniture Co. - Victrolas and Furn" 
  (showing the original RCA Victor dog trademark); "The First National Bank - Member Federal Reserve Bank"; "The Strand 
  Theatre Is Opposite Matison's"; "The Original Wallace Drug Company, Your Drug Store Across The Street On The Corner".  
  It was worth the price of admission.  We had taken a giant step back in time.
  <br /><br />
  Gay Houston, the young Radionian staffer from JCJC and Timothy Beard (Remember him? He was the King in Watkins "The 
  King And I".) were too young to remember any of the old places advertised, but Mack Cole and I could remember Pearson's 
  Ice Cream Parlour, which was once a favorite teenage hangout.
  <br /><br />
  We could even recall some of the Hyde's Dance Revues, which always took place at The Strand (we found one of their old  
  posters), and my memory even included a certain Tom Thumb Wedding where Marie Crumbley (now Mrs. Frank Therrell) was   
  the bridge and Henry Hilbun III, was the bridegroom.
  <br /><br />
  Directly in front of the stage we saw the organ in its special pit, and for a theatre of its times, this must have been 
  quite an instrument.  Most old theatres had only pianos, but The Strand was so grand it also had a pipe organ with 
  stops for sleigh bells, bird calls, sirens, a tom-tom, castanets and tambourines, all the better for accompanying 
  silent movies.  And Mrs. Ruth DeGruy, the wife of the manager, was the organist.  This old organ, probably not even 
  salvageable now, is a Kilgen, signed George Kilgen and Son, St. Louis.  Faded and torn in a nearby box was sheet music 
  with titles like "Under The Moon"; "Mazie"; "Where Are You My Heart"; "The Spanish Dancer", and "Song In The Dessert".  
  And stacks of organ pipes mildewed in a tiny dressing room.
  <br /><br />
  It is hoped this reminiscing is as much fun for you, dear readers, as it was for us, for there is lots more to tell.  
  However, space limitations prevent telling it all in one article, so we'll continue our tale as soon as possible.
  <br /><br />
  Coming up next installment will be something interesting we found backstage as well as remembrances of special things 
  past by some of those Laurelites who recall the glorious heyday of The Strand.

            MORE "ONCE UPON A TIME"<br />
            By Marda Burton for the Laurel Leader-Call&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;February 22, 1969
        </span>
    </strong>
    <br /><br />
    Intermission is over, and we're again reminiscing about The Strand...Laurel's one and only abandoned 
    and deserted vaudeville theatre, recently revisited.  To go backstage one would think it had always been
    abandoned and unused.  At first flashlight arc it seemed a muddle of torn out theatre seats, stacked 
    chairs, grimy flats, rigging and flying scenery.
    <br /><br />
    But back to the flats again - proof positive that it was use in 1947 for a high school play called
    "Strictly Formal" - for the entire cast had autographed the set.  They did it to pass the time,
    little knowing that many years later a cast member would find her maiden name staring at her from the darkness.
    <br /><br />
    The narrow beam of light illuminated the words, "Marda Kaiser - Jane".  The light moved on to see the
    names of Clytee Hughes, True Cauble, Edith Smith, Marie Crumbley, Gaston White, Clay Lee, Jimmy Tant, 
    Bette Hines, Bill Daly, Ann Morgan, Bonnie Fleming, Jane McLeod, Charles Simmons, Elias Asmar and Ann Turman,
    all of whom got good reviews and packed houses back in March of 1947 in a farce about dates.
    <br /><br />
    Margaret Rushton and Johnny Hassell were the student directors, and between the acts "Viennese Valse"
    was performed by dancers Mary Holder and Phillip Smith, Annette Sheppard and Joe Tullos, Marcelle Pearcey
    and Graham Christian, Sylvia Mapp and Clarence Profilet, Joan Barbour and James Dickey, Frances McBride and 
    Alex Case - all accompanied by L.D. Burkett and Bina Ruth Brown on piano and violin and directed by student
    Sue Ainsworth.
    <br /><br />
    But as exciting as high school plays were back then, they couldn't hold a candle (or an Edison lamp
    globe) to the performances which went on when The Strand was new and shiny, built by the late Wallace B. Rogers 
    with extremely fine acoustics, sight lines and theatre equipment which even time can't erase.
    <br /><br />
    Mrs. Doye Dickey, librarian at Watkins High School, remembers when road shows came to The Strand at least
    twice a month playing to packed houses.  Excellent New York casts appeared in such plays as "Daddy Longlegs" 
    and between the acts, a chorus line would entertain.  Other times she went to the silent movies for just a 
    dime and mooned over her favorites, Rudolph Valentino and Norma Shearer.
    <br /><br />
    Mrs. Katie Hyche recalls sitting in The Strand's balcony with her enthralled second grade at a concert
    performance of the Minneapolis Symphony done especially for school children.  A hometown group tackled
    "The Mikado" with the late Frank Sullivan in the lead, and Tommy Gibbons pronounced The Strand "much more
    than a mere vaudeville house" as he remembered his friend Phil Baker playing the accordion on the wide stage.
    <br /><br />
    It was said that when the late Sank Taylor bought The Strand that he just "had to have it because the seats
    had ST (for The Strand or maybe for Sank Taylor) on them.  There, also, Sank's daughter Evelyn began her 
    dancing career in Hyde's Dance Revues, going on to Broadway, and coming home to do 
    benefit performances for Laurel charities.  Where? Why, at The Strand, of course.
    <br /><br />
    Before The Strand was built, Laurel's culture came in huge doses called chautauquas, identified in the 
    dictionary as "an assembly for education and entertainment of adults by lectures, concerts, etc. held 
    for several days."  These tent shows were set up adjacent to the Court House and jail, and the children
    were usually sent to the matinees because they would cry at the usually melodramatic fare and disturb 
    the grownups.
    <br /><br />
    But after The Strand was built it became the hub around which Laurel's cultural and entertainment life
    revolved.  A March 18, 1928 issue of the Laurel Daily Leader (found in the box with the sheet music)
    mentions The Strand some half dozen times on the Women's Pages, not counting the ads. That day the bill 
    included Emil Jennings in Paramount's "The Last Command" plus James Richmond's "Sizzling Men" and a musical revue
     - "Full of Pep", under the auspices of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.
    <br /><br />
    Yes, the old Strand was full of pep back then, but in its dark, silent interior today only the ghosts of
    these past accomplishments linger, their memorial crumbling and dusty, rather sad.
    <br /><br />
    The nice ghosts are no doubt rather sad too, because they probably see the handwriting on the dusty wall 
    and the slimness of the last chance.  For this tale is not likely to have a happy ending.  Does urban
    renewal include the restoration of the old landmark as a cultural asset and tourist attraction or must it 
    soon go to make way for progress?  If it must, it must - but what a shame.
    <br /><br />
    I can hear it now, just as future generation will, "Did you know Laurel once had a real vaudeville theatre? 
    But they tore it down.  It was right there where the Ten Dollar Store is now."  Then, only as long as 
    someone is left to remember, will the memories of The Strand "live happily ever after."

            DARK AND DAMP - OLD THEATRE REVEALS LAUREL'S PAST<br />
            By Gae Houston for the JCJC Radionian&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March 25, 1969
        </span>
    </strong>
    <br /><br />
  Four questers sought to find something new and different in the old Strand Theatre.  There were four:  Marda Burton of 
  the Laurel Leader-Call; Hunter Cole, an English teacher at JCJC; Gae Houston, staff member for the Radionian, and 
  Timothy Beard, a student at Jones and the guide for the tour.
  <br /><br />
  These four set out, flashlights-in-hand, to conquer all foes and get the inside story on the oldest theatre in Laurel.  
  The expedition was formed to see what there was to see.  Four entered the dark, damp building, and four returned - 
  despite rats, falling ceiling and squeaking steps.
  <br /><br />
  Entering a silent, empty building which was meant to be full of sound gave the four an eerie feeling, but they plodded on,
  becoming less eager by the minute.  The sun shining through the dusty window panes produced weird shadows and designs on
  the spiderweb-covered walls of the room which once housed the concession stand.  In this room children who are now 
  grandparents and great-grandparents spent their pennies and nickles for delicious cofections.  Now the room was empty, 
  deserted by those who loved it most.
  <br /><br />
  Onward together, the four turned on their flashlights as they entered the auditorium.  The huge room echoed their 
  voices as they walked toward the front.
  <br /><br />
  Four lights beamed up toward what should have been the screen on which the scenes of love, hate, and apathy gleamed, 
  but lights found an old drop which was the old method of advertising.  The four discovered that the advertisements were 
  of the same types as modern ones.  There was Coca-Cola; Pearson's Ice Cream - Best Because It's Pure"; Graves, Lindsey 
  & McLaurin; Wallace Drug Store; First National Bank; Fine Bros. Matison; Laurel Furniture Company - For Victrolas and 
  New Home Sewing Machines; Howard E. Greer - For Edison Lamp Globes; and Myer Shelby Buick - For Parts and Accessories 
  For Your Car.  The flashlights criss-crossed as each person read the signs painted on the drop.  Then the lights 
  dropped and settled on a large curtain-covered object in the orchestra pit.
  <br /><br />
  Underneath was an old Kilgen pipe organ.  The four searched for something different about the organ - and when just 
  ready to give up - found it.  On the floor near the regular foot pedals were found some buttons for sound effects.  
  These were used in the silent movies for effects like sleigh bells, bird calls, sirens, Indian tom-toms, and Spanish 
  castanets and tambourines.
  <br /><br />
  The search continued backstage where Mrs. Burton found her name written on a piece of set which was used for the class 
  play the year she graduated.  At this time the theatre was used for more than movies.  Class plays and recitals were 
  only a part of its use.
  <br /><br />
  After plundering around in what were once dressing rooms for the traveling players who came to Laurel, the four decided 
  to go downstairs and see what was under the stage, discovering the heating system was not exactly what they expected, 
  but onward they trudged.  A door was found.  All stood back wondering what they would find lurking behind the door.  
  Would it be rats, or some old important papers for which they were searching?  Someone suddenly became brave and opened 
  the door.  No rats came scurrying out, so the four flashed lights into the room.  There were old mats which were used 
  in advertising in the newspapers, and one found papers telling about the movies.  The four dug and tried to find some 
  really old reviews of movies, but they failed.  The search did reveal movies from Republic, RKO, Warner Bros. and 
  Universal Studios.
  <br /><br />
  Tired feet carried the four back upstairs to search for some old sheet music which was used by the organist for silent 
  movies.  Boxes containing music were found, but not much of it was intact.  Rain and rats had destroyed much of the old 
  music, but some sheets were found with the signature of Ruth DeGruy on them.  Some research revealed that Mr. DeGruy 
  was the manager of the original theatre, and his wife, Ruth, played for the silent films.  The two of them lived in an 
  apartment located in the back of what was the projection room until Mr. DeGruy died.
  <br /><br />
  The search continued until an old newspaper was pulled out of the rubble.  It was dated March 28, 1928.  All 
  flashlights lit the pages as eyes read about the entertainment presented at that theatre at that time.  The title was 
  "Sizzling Men" with an all local cast.  The prices for the show were a dime for those seats in the balcony and fifteen 
  cents for the orchestra seats.
  <br /><br />
  The four weary travelers ended their journet.  They had stepped into Laurel's past for a short time.  The old theatre 
  had opened its arms to those who sought, and they had found a past of which to be proud.

            LAUREL LITTLE THEATRE OPENS<br />
            by S. M. Welborne in the Laurel Leader-Call&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;January, 1978
        </span>
    </strong>
    <br /><br />
    Moving from stage to stage for 17 years, Laurel's self supporting community theatre has found a permanent
    home in the old Arabian Theatre.  With $40,000 of donated money, a decaying theatre built in 1927 was 
    restored to its original splendor.
    <br /><br />
    The conversion, which took 2,000 hours of volunteer labor, consisted of extending the stage, installing 
    dressing rooms, bathrooms and a new kitchen, painting and rewiring the entire theatre.  The original
    Egyptian and Arabic style decorations were restored giving the theatre much the same look it had when it 
    open in the late 1920's.  The building committee was spearheaded by J.W. (Bill) Clinton, Ernest Graves,
    R.G.Hynson and Clayton Corley.
    <br /><br />
    The restored theatre held a grand opening November 28, 1977 with the performance of "Our Town." 
    All 257 seats were filled for the play's first two performances.  The theatre has sold 800 memberships 
    for the 1977-78 Season.  A $12 membership entitles the member to attend each production.  The 
    musical "Guys &amp; Dolls" is in rehearsal now with the performances scheduled for February 22-25, 1978.

        <span class="showtitle">EARLY HISTORY OF LAUREL LITTLE THEATRE
            <br />by Marda Kaiser Burton for the Laurel Leader-Call&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May 1982
        </span>
    </strong>
    <br /><br />
    In 1961, two would-be actresses, Mary Anne Hays Sumrall and I, got together and decided that Laurel needed 
    a stage to play upon.  Both of us had a good deal of experience on other stages: mine in Jackson, hers at 
    USM.  We had caught the acting bug in Laurel High School and Rotary Club theatrics.
    <br /><br />
    Next, we met with a couple of other "hams," including Ernest Graves and Gene Gandrau, at the bowling alley 
    next door to the Leader-Call where I worked part-time and where Mary Ann's father, Ralph Hays, was managing 
    editor.
    <br /><br />
    Ernest reminded us of an earlier time, back in the late 1940s, when a community theater began in Laurel, 
    but failed after only two productions.  This time there was no stopping us; it simply had to be.  By now 
    there were active community theaters all over the state, even a Mississippi Little Theater Association, and 
    we saw no reason why Laurel shouldn't have one, too.
    <br /> <br />
    So an enthusiastic group, with Ernest as front man, met Tuesday night, August 29, in the Green Room of
    the Pinehurst Hotel.  Elliot Trimble of Natchez, president of the Mississippi Little Theater Association, 
    attended and gave us good organizing advice.  The few people who said it wouldn't work were shouted down.
    <br /> <br />
    Mary Anne and I couldn't talk Ernest into being president (or any other officer, for that matter) so it
    fell to me.  Mary Anne took VP in charge of production, and we drafted energetic Annie Ruth Grim to be VP 
    in charge of membership.  Secretary was Ruth Tomlinson, and W.E. (Billy) Howard, Jr. consented to handle the money.
    <br /> <br />
    Original board members were Blanche Bailey, Rosemary Bouchillon, Gene Gandrau, Irene Fine, Billy Lightsey,
    Mary Mobberly, John Suffling, and Bob Westover.  Immediately after the meeting, the board met to choose 
    the season's plays and a casting committee composed of Eleanor Bass, Gordon Berry,Mrs. Bob Martins,
    Mrs. William G. Snoddy, and Dot Traweek.
    <br /> <br />
    Tryouts were to be held immediately upon receipt of the first playbooks.  We knew we'd better capitalize 
    fast on the great initial enthusiasm, so a membership campaign began immediately (September 5-13), and 
    three plays were announced: "Born Yesterday" (director Elton Bateman), "Dial M for Murder" 
    (director Bob Martins), and "The Curious Savage" (director Ruth Tomlinson).
    <br /> <br />
    Because of our Leader-Call connections, we received extensive newspaper publicity, and radio and TV 
    stations took up our cause, too.  We were big news; the first membership drive netted more than 600
    season-ticket-holders.   Our plays were presented for two nights on the cavernous and acoustically poor 
    stage of the Wisner Building.  Jackson theater reviewer Frank Hains came to our opening night and noted: 
    "This building was built for almost every known indoor athletic and recreational event, with the possible 
    exception of a little theater play."
    <br /> <br />
    However, both actors and audiences 'made do' and "Born Yesterday" was a huge hit with Lowell Tew as 
    Harry Brock, Doris Miller as Billie Dawn, and Jim Gibbon as the reporter.  Lowell pulled a tendon in 
    his leg just before opening night, and his brace and cane were successfully written into the plot.  The
    production was also distinguished by the casting of Tommy Lester (later of "Green Acres" fame) as the 
    shoeshine boy who had only one line to say.
    <br /> <br />
    Mary Anne took the lead in the season's second play, "Dial M for Murder," along with Dr. Colmore Rinehart
    and a debuting Chet Dillard.  Connie Farrell and Auby Rowell were policemen.  My husband, Richard Burton,
    was prevailed upon to play the part of the murdered would-be murderer, also his stage debut.  He did so well 
    (you could even hear him, which is difficult to do in real life) that everyone assumed we had discovered a 
    future star. However, my laconic Dick immediately put an end to that when asked to attend the next auditions.
    He answered with his favorite sentence:  "I've been."
    <br /><br />
    The third play, about the inmates of a madcap madhouse, starred Mary Mobberly and included such talents 
    as Loring Burgess, Judy King, Granville Walters, James Wheeler, Glenn Ruffin, Ronnie Davis, Dot Traweek,
    Sharon Henderson and Marj Craft.  According to reviewer Helen West, the audience went away "with misty eyes 
    and palms warm from continuous applause."
    <br /> <br />
    The first season saw 29 individuals onstage and countless persons backstage.  A constitution was adopted
    and all officers and board members re-elected for 1962 (legally, the only time this could happen).  With 
    the completion in 1962 of the new R.H. Watkins High School, the next season's plays were acted on a more 
    suitable stage.  Still, even the Watkins auditorium was too big for the intimacy required by most plays; 
    and rehearsal time was quite limited.  Mason School auditorium didn't work either.  The very first play 
    review mentioned our dream:  Gene Gandrau wrote: "Wouldn't it be nice if someone could find an abandoned 
    building that would be suitable for this wide-awake organization to take over and convert into a real 
    Little Theater building where members could have a permanent place to rehearse, work on sets and give performances?
    <br /> <br />
    It was not until 1967 that LLT secured the old Armory in the Civic Center, did a magnificent interior 
    building job under the guidance of  architect John Hunt, and had its own home at last, at least until 1976 
    when the Civic Center was torn down as part of Laurel's urban renewal project.  Generating enthusiasm among 
    amateur actors and production people, all busy with real-life occupations, was not always easy.  However, the first
    sparks somehow were never lost; no matter the problems, the show always went on 'on schedule' and to appreciative
    audiences.  Having a real home gave the organization a new and welcome impetus.  The first play presented in
    the new theater building was "The Odd Couple," directed by Dennis Bailey, with Lowell Tew playing the prissy
    Felix and John Bisnette as the slovenly Oscar.
    <br /> <br />
    Meanwhile, the six years of hard work had given Laurel at least 18 of Broadway's best offerings, and 
    excellent performances by many Laurelites.  Their reactions ranged from Pat Westover's "I felt like throwing
    up every time I had an entrance" ("The Man who Came to Dinner"), to Page Jones 
    Harris's "You'll have to drag me off the stage to make me stop" (Maggie in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof").
    <br /> <br />
    During those years I remember ripping down my dining room drapes (like Scarlett O'Hara) to make the ball
    gown for my part as Tracy Lord in "The Philadelphia Story."  On the second night of performance my entire 
    body turned red and itchy, because, unknown to me, the drapes were made of some weird synthetic material
    called fiberglass.
    <br /> <br />
    Another time, Ruth Tomlinson, after getting almost every gal in town to be in the cast of "The Women" 
    (44 of them), unexpectedly added actress to her director role when Sharon Valentine's husband had a heart attack.
    <br /><br />
    In 1964, a highlight of the season was the production of "All the Way Home" directed by Broadway 
    actor Rufus Smith, the husband of Laurel's own Broadway dancer Evelyn Taylor.  To publicize the play we 
    put on a parade of old cars and costumes.  Many times we utilized such publicity gimmicks. One almost backfired,
    when we staged a gunman's (John Hunt) mock-escape from the police station and an off-duty policeman 
    thought it was the real 
    thing.           
    <br /> <br />
    In 1966, LLT took part in Laurel's Fine Arts Week with "Our Town," directed by Ruth Tomlinson, 
    and by importing Jackson's Frank Hains and Jane Petty, both New Stage actors, for "An Evening of 
    Theatre" at Lauren Rogers.
    <br /> <br />
    In 1968, a goal of 1,000 members was set and met, LLT hosted a statewide meeting of the Mississippi 
    Little Theater Association, and a directors' workshop was held.  The first musical, "The Apple Tree," 
    was presented in 1969.  LLT put on talent parties, and gave out "Laurel Awards," introduced patron parties 
    and memberships, and went to a sold-out four-night run.
    <br /> <br />
    In 1970, professional directors began to be utilized on a regular basis, including Don Toner, Robert Mesrobian, 
    and Blaine Quarnstrom, the latter two USM faculty.  Mike Howard, choral and theater director at R.H. Watkins 
    High School, later director of Tulane's Summer Lyric Theatre, was responsible for many of LLT's popular musicals 
    as well as several dramas.  Around this time, Robert Lowe and Wess Hughes took on directing honors, too.  
    LLT is most fortunate that throughout the years it has had access to talented directors, both amateur and professional.
    <br /> <br />
    After the Civic Center containing the theater was demolished in 1976, Laurel Little Theater lost no time 
    in restoring the downtown Arabian Theater to its former movie grandeur.  Since 1977 its permanent home
    boasts an elegant 1927 Persian/Egyptian decor fully as theatrical as the organization's original purpose: 
    to present the very best live theater possible and to offer an outlet for those who want to take part in
    the exciting life of the theater.
    <br /><br />
    ***A version of this history of LLT was first written for the Laurel Leader-Call in 1982, when Marda Burton
    was editor of the newspaper's Centennial Edition, dated May 11, 1982.  Mrs. Burton is now a well-known 
    freelance writer, a contributing editor for Veranda magazine, and co-author of Galatoire's: Biography of 
    a Bistro.

        <span class="showtitle">HUGHES DIGS THE THEATRE<br />by Dena Bisnette for the Laurel Leader-Call&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May 1983
            <br />The Pine Belt's Most Important Action People Tabloid
        </span>
    </strong>
    <br /><br />
    Several years ago, Wess Hughes became involved in a hobby that has become a sort of second occupation to him. 
    It takes up as much time as a second job, but he doesn't get paid for doing it.
    <br /><br />
    Hughes moved to Laurel after he graduated from high school on the other side of the state and he took a 
    job with Laurel's Pizza Hut the first day it opened here.  He kept that job while attending college and 
    afterwards he eventually became the restaurant's manager and eventually a district manager for the franchise.
    <br /><br />
    At the same time, Hughes has become a permanent fixture in almost anything having to do with live theatre 
    in Laurel and Hattiesburg.  He is the past president of Laurel Little Theatre and serves on the board of 
    directors for both LLT and Hattiesburg's Civic Light Opera, and he directs or acts in several productions 
    each season in both cities.
    <br /><br />
    "I saw a play at LLT the first year I moved to Laurel in 1974, and it was one of the very first live 
    stage performances I'd ever seen anywhere," Hughes said.  "I had never seen much live theatre growing up, 
    just a few high school productions, but I thought I could do that too, and so I tried out for LLT's very 
    next production.  I've been in every play since as an actor, director or member of the crew."
    <br /><br />
    Hughes got started directing plays his second year with LLT when a director dropped out at the last 
    minute and he was asked to take his place.  He has directed many small plays since and then became 
    involved directing large-scale musicals a few years ago when LLT selected 
    <i><strong>The Sound Of Music</strong></i> as its featured opening show for the year.
    <br /><br />
    Hughes said directing musicals usually involves working with about 100 people and is much harder than 
    directing a smaller cast.  "I was the first one they could sucker into it," he commented.  However, he 
    liked it so much he has directed the huge musicals for the organization every year since, and he has also
    become involved with producing children's theatre projects with the Laurel Junior Auxiliary, directing
    benefits for the local Cancer Society, and helping local schools and churches with their own productions.
    <br /><br />
    "The reward in this is so great.  It's fun, people applaud you for your hard work and they just all seem 
    to love it," Hughes explained.  "It's also about the only way I meet people because I'm not extremely
    social, but at the theatre I meet people from all walks of life."
    <br /><br />
    "A lot of people are reluctant to try out for plays because they think they're not talented enough.
    Most of them don't realize that most of the ones who try out do in fact get parts.  Last year, 98% of 
    everyone that auditioned at LLT got involved in our productions.  We can almost always fill the lead roles, 
    but we have to beg, borrow or steal to get supporting actors and chorus scenes filled.
    <br /><br />
    His interest in the theatre has taken Hughes outside of the local area to appearing in plays with other 
    theatre groups in Hattiesburg, Meridian, Jackson and even down in New Orleans.
    <br /><br />
    It also takes him to New York City, where he has been taking a group of theatre lovers about twice a year 
    since he was in school at Jones County Junior College and the University of Southern Mississippi.  Usually, 
    Hughes goes there to watch plays and brings back ideas that can be used locally.  "I see anywhere from 
    50 to 100 shows a year and many of those are in NYC.  All my ideas come from what I see everywhere else.
    I sometimes see some subject matter Laurel isn't ready for and for some shows I know we don't have an 
    actor here with the specific ability required."
    <br /><br />
    Hughes said, "On some plays I wait a few years before doing them to see if the right actor will 
    come along.  With others, I know we have a couple of people in town with the requirements," Hughes said.
    <br /><br />
    On one of his recent trips, Hughes did something different.  To see how a professional audition 
    would go, he tried out for a part in a new off-Broadway comedy.  Ultimately, after several rounds of 
    auditions, he was offered the role.  He had successfully auditioned against 120 other actors, but after 
    he found out he had been offered the part, he decided to turn the part down.
    <br /><br />
    One of his first reasons was that the play was new and might not be successful.  He also decided he would
    prefer to remain in Laurel and didn't want to go into professional acting.  "I didn't want to go into acting 
    because no matter how talented you may be, it takes a lot of constant luck.  Only a couple percent of the actors 
    in NYC are working any given day.  I also didn't know if I would be that good there.  Here I have
    something to offer people and they appreciate me for it," he said.

            <br />by Anne Sanders for the Action Newspaper&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December 10, 1986
        </span>
    </strong>
        <br /><br />
        Growing up in Laurel meant spending every Saturday afternoon at the matinee at the Arabian Theatre 
        and when you got older you and your date had a glorious Saturday night at the theatre for no more 
        than $1.00 which included popcorn and a Coke.
        <br /> <br />
        This is one of the few remaining landmark structures in downtown Laurel as the demolition of the 
        Pinehurst Hotel will necessitate massive renovation to save the theatre.
        <br /> <br />
        Headed by Mr. and Mrs. William S. Mullins, III, a campaign is underway to raise $64,000 for the 
        renovation of the Arabian.  Two thirds of this amount was in hand Friday night so a big push is 
        being made through this week to raise the total amount by next Saturday.
        <br /> <br />
        The beautiful Arabian with its Arabic theme opened April 1, 1927 and was advertised as
        "Mississippi's finest and greatest theatre."  It was built by three of Laurel's pioneer citizens,  
        Charles Green, Ben Schneider and Sank Taylor.
        <br /> <br />
        From the silent movie era to the "talkies," the Arabian Theatre remained a movie theatre until 
        the mid-1970s when it was sold to Gulf States Theatre.  Sank Taylor remained active with the theatre 
        until it was sold.  When Gulf States closed the Arabian in 1976, it was purchased just a
        year later in 1977 by the Laurel Little Theatre which had lost its own home to urban renewal.  With
        more than 2,000 volunteer hours and a three year financial pledge program, the Arabian was restored 
        to its original splendor.
        <br /> <br />
        The late John Hunt, a Laurel architect, worked with LLT to restore the original details of the building 
        including the long walkway of a corridor.  A larger stage was constructed to accommodate the productions 
        of LLT, but the ornate proscenium arch was preserved as well as the gilt dentil work that accents the moulding.
        <br /> <br />
        Laurel's Arabian Theatre with its vintage architecture has been preserved along with the auditorium, 
        lobby and balcony and is very functional as a community facility seating more than 260 for musical 
        events, small conventions and civic programs.   More than a dozen different organizations have used the
        theatre since it was taken over by LLT.
        <br /> <br />
        The Little Theatre has provided entertainment for every age group from the Junior Auxiliary Children's
        plays to some of the finest musicals south of Broadway.
        <br /> <br />
        According to Mrs. Mullins, certain structural modifications need to be made to insure the visual 
        and structural integrity of the Arabian.  The funds are needed to retire a recent debt incurred 
        from water damage from Hurricane Juan which temporarily closed the theatre.  Other improvements are 
        needed to continue compliance with fire code regulations and making the facility accessible to the handicapped.
        <br /> <br />
        There is not a Laurelite who doesn't have fond memories of the Arabian.  Many held hands with the 
        opposite sex for the first time while watching a film there.  Others experienced their first shy 
        kiss between newsreels.  It was the meeting place for friends, especially on the balcony.  The usher 
        had to often quiet down the laughing and talking crowds.  Many had their first jobs as ticket sellers 
        and takers at the Arabian.
        <br /> <br />
        "Save the Arabian" is very important to thousands of Laurelites and those who would like to 
        contribute to this tax deductible project, regardless of how large or small, should send them 
        to: SAVE THE ARABAIN c/o Granville Walters, P.O.Box 1228 Laurel Ms 39441.  Make checks 
        payable to Laurel Little Theatre/Save the Arabian.

        <span class="showtitle">ARABIAN THEATRE ONE OF LAUREL'S LANDMARK BUILDINGS<br />by Marty Russell in the Laurel
            Leader-Call&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December 3rd, 1986
        </span>
    </strong>
    <br /><br />
    Like the phoenix gracing its proscenium arch, the Arabian Theatre in downtown Laurel is attempting to 
    rise from the decay of years of neglect and abuse to be transformed to its original splendor.
    <br /> <br />
    A fundraising drive is currently underway to raise money for the project, but, according to campaign 
    officials, the $64,000 being sought will only cover the bare necessities for making the 60-year old 
    theatre safe and habitable.
    <br /> <br />
    "We're not asking for money so we can go in and install brass doorknobs or new carpet," said Mike Pruitt,
    publicity director for the campaign.  "What we are asking for is just enough money to save the building 
    itself."
    <br /> <br />
    About $34,000 of the campaign's goal has already been received, Pruitt said, in advance contributions.
    <br /><br />
    $20,000 of the total will go toward construction of an exterior facade which will be necessary 
    when the Pinehurst Hotel is demolished next year.  The theatre and hotel share a common wall.
    <br /> <br />
    The largest share of the campaign's goal, $25,000 will be used to pay off a note due next spring from a 
    loan that was acquired to repair roof damage caused by Hurricane Juan last year.
    <br /> <br />
    The remainder of the funds, $19,000, will be used to bring the backstage area up to standard.  When the 
    Arabian was built it was considered the most elegant and comfortable facility of its kind in the state.
    <br /> <br />
    It made the transition to talkies with ease, but could not compete with television and the influx of 
    drive-in theatres and other movie cineplex houses to the Laurel area.  It closed as a movie theatre in 1977.
    <br /> <br />
    Constructed at a time when the world was intrigued by the treasures being unearthed in Egypt, the
    interior design features detailed molding in the style of that ancient country, but with a decidedly
    art deco slant.
    <br /> <br />
    "It was a very plush theatre," said longtime Laurel resident Ernest Graves.  "When the Little Theatre 
    took it over in 1977, it looked exactly as I remembered it in the 1930s."
    <br /> <br />
    Graves said the theatre was one of the primary centers of social activity in Laurel at that time.  
    "Children in the 30s didn't have much else to do except go to the movies," he said.  "There was 
    always good attendance there."
    <br /> <br />
    He said the Arabian competed with another theatre, the Strand, but was considered to be the 
    "first class" choice.  "The Strand had the serials and cowboy movies, and the Arabian has the 
    first runs," he said.  "The Strand was always considered sort of low brow while the Arabian was first class."

            LAST OF ORIGINAL MOVIE HOUSES STILL STANDS<br />
            in the Action Newspaper&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;August 18, 1988
        </span>
    </strong>
    <br /><br />
    The last of the original movie houses in Laurel still stands, but around it is rubbish where the once 
    elegant Pinehurst Hotel stood.  The theater building was part of the old hotel, but the Laurel Little
    Theatre saved the movie house from the wrecking crane.
    <br /><br />
    The late Sank Taylor opened the first movie house in Laurel in 1907 in the old O'Ferrell building.  
    He hung a sheet on the wall and 70 feet to the rear sat the mysterious machine that he had purchased 
    from a Meridian firm.  This machine gave Laurelites Valentino and all the Pearl Whites and Charlie Chapmans
    that have since inscribed their names in moviedom.
    <br /><br />
    Taylor once recalled that when a bull was turned out of a pen during a movie and charged across 
    the screen, he lost every boy in the house.  It was a reel about a bullfight in Mexico and it
    lasted a breathtaking seven minutes.
    <br /><br />
    There were no newspapers in those days so he went all over town advertising the event.  He used a
    buggy and a megaphone.  That night when the movie opened, there were more people standing outside 
    than there were inside.  Counting the boys who sat in rows between the seats, there were 265 people 
    in the building that night.
    <br /> <br />
    Taylor had broken the ice, a new heard-about, but for the most part unseen entertainment had come to 
    town and Taylor thought he was going to make it his oyster and he did for many years.
    <br /> <br />
    In the years that followed, Taylor opened several movie houses including the Strand Theatre 
    where now stands an empty lot on Central Avenue.  It was considered one of the state's finest 
    theatres back in its heyday.  That year was 1919 and the cost to its subscribers was $174,000, a lot of money 
    back then.
    <br /> <br />
    As things worked out, Taylor and the late Charles Green and the late Ben Schneider wound up with 
    possession of the Strand and built the Arabian Theatre in which he kept an interest as long as it 
    remained open.
    <br /><br />
    The Laurel Little Theatre purchased the old Arabian in 1977 when urban renewal took their own 
    building on South Magnolia and they restored the theatre to much of its Arabic splendor with 
    fresh walls and a new stage.  The foyer entrance was part of the hotel running underneath three stories of 
    hotel rooms.  The Little Theatre was able to use it as long as the hotel remained intact.
    <br /><br />
    Now, a side entrance is available as a temporary entrance.  The tornado and heavy rains which hit 
    Laurel damaged the roof, but the organization is determined to keep the Arabian alive through its many 
    fine productions each year and the dedication of its members.

            NOSTALGIC GLANCE AT "PICTURE SHOWS"<br />
            by Ernest Graves for the Laurel Leader-Call&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May 16, 1992
        </span>
    </strong>
    <br /><br />
    In the 30's and early 40's, Laurel didn't have any "movies"' or "films."  Nobody knew what the cinema was.
    VCRs and videotapes scheduled for the 21st century were figments of the imagination.
    <br /><br />
    But Laurel had several excellent picture shows!
    <br /><br />
    In 1927, the Arabian Theatre was built and its decor looked Egyptian as well as what its name indicated.
    <br /><br />
    But, not to worry, for it was a grand setting for the showing of the likenesses of John Barrymore, 
    Carole Lombard, Wallace Beery and dozens of other dazzling stars.  It was the place to be for a big
    evening of Hollywood entertainment.
    <br /><br />
    There were feature attractions such as "King Kong," "Grand Hotel," "Magnificent Obsession" and 
    "Gone With The Wind."   The later epic went on and on for four hours which persuaded the school authorities 
    to declare a holiday one afternoon so that students could see it uninterrupted in all of the Clark Gable
    glory and Vivian Leigh beauty.
    <br /><br />
    Short subjects such as Fox Movietone News, Disney cartoons, the March of Time and "Pete Smith" 
    specials were included.  I wonder how long it's been since you thought about that last one.
    <br /><br />
    In the 70's, after television exacted its toll on the old movie palaces, the Arabian was, fortunately 
    for Laurel, purchased in 1977 by the Laurel Little Theatre and was renovated and the decor restored.
    <br /><br />
    The number two picture show was the spacious Strand which was located next door to where Fred's Department
    Store is located today on the Downtown  Mall.  A vacant lot now commemorates the Strand's prior existence.
    <br /><br />
    The Strand was a duplicate of the old Broadway theatres of that era with fly ropes, flats and all the 
    trappings which would attract traveling stage productions to come to town.
    <br /><br />
    It was also used by the Laurel Exchange Club for some of its plays, by Gardiner High School 
    for its production annually and by the Rotary Club for the yearly Minstrel Show.
    <br /><br />
    As an added attraction, its owner, Sank Taylor, spurred the attendance sometimes by letting the 
    audience play "Screen-O," a projected spinning wheel game of chance where the winning ticket holders 
    received show passes or 'China' (actually blown Depression glass).
    <br /><br />
    Cowboy and Indian heaven was the synonym for the Strand on Saturday afternoons.  Tickets were ten 
    cents and swarms of children would spend three or four hours cheering Tom Mix, Hoot Gibson, Bob Steele 
    and other fearless horse opera heroes of the wild west.
    <br /><br />
    The theatre was not 'cleared' of the paying customers after each showing as is the custom today and
    they could stay all afternoon if they wished.  The viewers could also see the 'serial' more than once.
    <br /><br />
    I believe that the all-time favorite serial concerned the adventures of one Flash Gordan-shown by 
    installment for a period of not less than 15 weeks.
    <br /><br />
    Incidentally, Evelyn Taylor, Sank's daughter, fortified by happy Arabian and Strand viewings
    was very successful in ballet theatre in New York.  She danced in the Agnes DeMille troupe on the 
    Broadway stage and later in Hollywood danced in the film of the spectacular musical "Oklahoma."
    <br /><br />
    Still later, Evelyn turned artist and attained more success in her art showings here and in Europe.
    <br /><br />
    Three other Laurel picture shows were the Lincoln on Maple Street, the Royal on North Magnolia and the
    Jean on Central Avenue, all of which usually showed "B" class movies, as contrasted to the "A" class 
    shown at the Arabian.
    <br /><br />
    Incidentally, those class ratings had nothing whatsoever to do with the present day moral codes 
    concerning decency and non-violence (i.e., G, PG and R).  Movies in that day and age were all family 
    fare, as controlled by the Hayes Office in Hollywood.  What a change compared to the present situation!
    <br /><br />
    As the director asked the camerman:  "What does your picture show?"
    <br /><br />
    Drawing this curtain is overdue.

            LAUREL STAGE REMEMBERS SUCCESS<br />
            by Ernest Graves in the Laurel Leader-Call&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December 25, 1992
        </span>
    </strong>
    <br /><br />
    "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players."   Shakespeare "As You Like It"
    <br /><br />
    The second Laurel Little Theatre came into being in 1961.  Gordon Berry tells me that the first such 
    theatre was active in the thirties or forties.
    <br /><br />
    During the past 31 years, the group has staged about four productions a year.  For a small town to
    have presented about 120 comedies and musicals (numbering approximately 400 total performances) in that 
    time period is nothing short of impressive.
    <br /><br />
    During the sixties and seventies the plays were produced in several locations including the Wisner 
    Building, Watkins High School, Gardiner Elementary and Mason Elementary, until the Theatre got a 
    "permanent home" in the Civic Center, which was shortly thereafter demolished when urban renewal took its toll.
    <br /><br />
    In the mid-seventies the late Bob Hynson, the late Bill Clinton, Bobby Hynson, Bill Mullins and 
    Gardiner Green, Jr., with the help for other volunteers, raised nearly $80,000 to purchase and 
    renovate that architectural delight, the Arabian Theatre.
    <br /><br />
    Remember carefully as some talented Thespians come down center stage, blink at the footlights, 
    and share their moments of glory in the spotlight which burns no brighter on Broadway than in South Mississippi.
    <br />

    <ul class="llist_edc">
        <li>The late Lowell Tew, Elmer Gosset, John Neill and Tommy Lester in "Born Yesterday."  Lester later became "Eb" on television's Green Acres

        <li>Page Harris as Blanche DuBois (the Laurel schoolteacher) in "A Streetcar Named Desire."</li>
        <li>Wess Hughes, John Jeffries, Bill Green and Ernest Graves in "Count Dracula."</li>
        <li>The late Mary Mobberly in "Damn Yankees."</li>
        <li>
            Skipper Schwartzfager, Betty Whitt and Miles Bilek in "Barefoot In The Park" which was 
            directed by Dennis Bailey, who later sung with the NYC Metropolitan Opera.
        </li>

        <li>Mare Melichar and Michael Howard in "Man of LaMancha."</li>
        <li>John Bisnette, Ann Tomlinson Reeder and Tom Elias in "The Fantasticks."</li>
        <li>
            Nita Faye Ferris, L.H. Walker, Catherine Anderson, Dan Walters and Kathy Dearman in the first 
            LLT production of "Harvey."
        </li>
        <li>
            Parker Posey in the second production of "Harvey" who has recently been acting on 
            CBS television and Hollywood movies.
        </li>
        <li>Marda Burton in "The Philadelphia Story."</li>
        <li>
            Bill Lightsey in "All The Way Home" which was directed by Rufus Smith, Evelyn Taylor's Broadway 
            actor husband.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
<p class="normal">
    And don't forget that the plays would not have been "hits" without competent directors including the 
    late Ruth Tomlinson, Betty Whitt and Liz Chesser and without expert and loyal support from members.
    <br /><br />
    Since this article is nostalgia oriented, there is no mention of the fabulous eighties and nineties.
    Because of limited space, there have been many regrettable omissions about earlier productions.
    <br /><br />
    The Little Theatre has given several professional performers their starts.  It also has brought 
    countless hours of appreciation for the stage and enjoyment for the local audiences.
