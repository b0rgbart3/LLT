        The first house ever erected in this city was destroyed Tuesday.  It was a pine log affair on Maple Street, 
        occupied by Negroes.  It was built thirty years ago, when Laurel consisted of merely a saw mill.
        <br /><br />
        There were over 2,000 attendants at the opening of the city schools.  The enrollment is expected to 
        reach 4,000.  The new Pinehurst Hotel, with 100 rooms, has been completed.<br />

        <strong>NEW HOTEL IS OPENED

        Laurel Citizens Sit At Grown-In-Mississippi Banquet<br />
        Special to The Times-Picayune<br />
        Laurel, Miss, November 4, 1914 – Nearly four hundred guests were present last evening when Hotel Pinehurst was 
        opened with a “grown in Mississippi” dinner, prepared and served by the ladies of the Episcopal Church under 
        the auspices of the Laurel Commercial Club.  The dinner was arranged for competition for the handsome silver 
        cup by a well-known Jackson jeweler, donated through the State Department of Agriculture.  The city which distances 
        the showing made by Laurel last evening will have to score high.  The menu was excellent, consisting entirely of 
        edibles collected from the farms of Mississippi, and was faultlessly served.  All of the 103 members of the 
        Commercial Club were present, and this alone counts for 30 per cent in the competition for the cup.  As the 
        event marked the opening of Laurel’s handsome new hotel, the Pinehurst, which has just been completed at a 
        cost of more than $100,000, Manager Pontaine aided materially in making the event a success, and was 
        accorded a resolution of thanks by the Commerical Club for his interest in the affair.<br />

            <br />The Biloxi-Gulfport Daily Herald&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;November 25, 1929
        </strong>
        <br /><br />
        Laurel, Miss, Nov. 25 – The American Legion will urge the adoption by Congress this winter of the resolution
        looking toward passage of the universal service law.  O.L. Bodenhamer, national commander of the legion,
        said this in an address here today following a luncheon given in his honor by the Marvin E. Stainton
        post of the American Legion.
        <br /><br />
        The luncheon was attended by Legionnaires from other posts in the section of Mississippi, the local Legion
        Auxiliary and members of the Kiwanis and Rotary Clubs, who arranged their own luncheons to be with chief of the veterans.
        <br /><br />
        Commander Bodenhamer arrived in Laurel at 9 o’clock this morning and participated in a conference of Legionnaires 
        from South Mississippi at the Arabian Theatre before noon.  He was the honored guest of the consolidated luncheon
        of veterans and civic clubs, and the public was invited to hear his address immediately thereafter in the

        <strong>THEATRE MANAGERS INDICTED AT LAUREL
            <br />The Huntsville Daily Times&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;October 12,  1930
        </strong>
        <br /><br />
        Laurel, Miss Oct 11 – Officers of the Strand Amusement Company, operators of the Strand and Arabian
        Theatres, motion picture houses, have been indicted on three counts each for operation of the two
        theatres on Sunday, by the grand jury which has made its final report to Judge W. Joe Pack in circuit
        court here.  Those indicted are Charles Green, Ben Schneider and W.S. Taylor.  The theatres have
        been operated without charge on Sunday for several weeks.
        <br /><br />
        Numerous other violations of the Sunday laws were brought to the attention of the grand jury, but no
        other indictments were made.  This was explained in the grand jury report in the following words:
        <br /><br />
        “We have had a great amount of evidence before us as to the violation of the Sabbath day, and it
        is alarming to every member of this grand jury of the growing spirit among the people and even the
        Christian people, to disregard, set aside and desecrate Sunday.  We have returned a few indictments,
        but we had evidence of over seventy violations of the Sunday law.  But of our motion, and without the
        advice or suggestion on the part of any person or attorney, have referred these seventy or eighty
        cases to the county court, to the justice of peace court and to the mayor’s court, where they can
        be handled, tried and disposed of with speed and without much cost to the tax payers.”<br />
