        <span class="showtitle">MAGNIFICENT NEW THEATRE FOR LAUREL
            <br />"THE ARABIAN"-REAL PALACE OF ORIENTAL SPLENDOR
            <br />by Mrs. Dewey Gardiner for the Laurel Daily Leader 
            Special Arabian Tabloid Section&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March 31, 1927
        </span>
    </strong>
    <br /><br />
     First you wonder why the name, and in a varying scale, it suggests the outstanding characteristics 
     of a far country.  To the small boy, "The Arabian" brings to mind pictures of a gallant sheik on a fine horse: 
     to the lovely girl, it portrays a harem full of highly-scented and  leisurely ladies:  to the man of deep
     thinking, it brings a thought of Mohammed, whose followers still number more than any other religious 
     cult in the world: to the political economist, it suggest the first and most successful attempt at
     prohibition for the "Sons of the Prophet" drink nothing but water: and to the antiquarian, it means a 
     research into age-old symbols, as significant as they are beautiful.
     <br /><br />
     Let's take a stroll through the Arabian and see for ourselves.  The gaily-colored marquise, with its 
     orange, green and black stripes, is distinctly Arabian.  And as we set foot on the adamantine of oriental 
     design, forming a flooring to the entrance, we are immediately enveloped with the oriental charm that 
     is everywhere apparent.  It is, as if some weird Arab crystal gazer had cast his spell over the 
     entire setting. 
     <br /><br />
     We progress through a long arcade and we almost turn topsy-turvy in our effort to see overhead the 
     ornamental plaster cornice, connected with oak beams, bearing inlaid decorations.  On either side 
     are mystic symbols of the ancient East.  The Egyptian sun god and the scarab, the symbol found on King
     Tut's belt, play a large part in the decorative effects, not only in the arcade, but throughout the 
     entire theatre.  How exquisitely soft and at the same time, how very interesting are the lights with 
     their decorations of lotus blossoms and serpents, which are found in different dimensions on the large
     chandeliers to the very smallest wall lights.  The attention cannot fail to be drawn to the very unusual 
     plastering of an Eastern texture and the imitation stone that constitutes the dado of the side 
     walls.  The ticket window, always an important stopping place at any theatre, is located at the far end 
     of the arcade.  Its base is interesting for the reason that it is fashioned of rare Verde antique marble, 
     the most costly that can be had.
     <br /><br />
     From the arcade, you sink into the velvety softness of luxurious carpets that form the floor covering 
     of the foyer lounge.  The furnishings here are all so lovely and so entirely in line with the taste of
     the decorative scheme.  Colorful floor lamps, deep chairs and divans of richest upholstery suggest the 
     warmth of welcome.  At the south end of the lounge, the exit doorway is covered with a real Arabian
     spear awning, a replica of that found on the exterior, while at the north end, is the ladies' rest 
     room, the entrance to which is exclusively of Egyptian imagery.
     <br /><br />
     The main auditorium, with seats for nine hundred, each a choice seat, is a marvel of constructive 
     achievement.  It insures each of the nine-hundred guests of splendid and normal view of the pictures
     from every part of the theatre, giving each person a comfortable seat, easy of access, and amid the
     most beautiful of surroundings.  The decorative effects denote faithful attention to each exquisite detail. 
     Here the dominant color scheme is repeated on the walls and ceiling.  The only decided variance from 
     the decorations used elsewhere are the Persian niches, which alternate with stenciled wall decorations,
     also of Persian and Egyptian design.  The colorful and harmonious lighting effects continue to show
     serpents and lotus blossoms.  The organ grills are treated most interestingly, with receded columns 
     and bands and Persian hangings.
     <br /><br />
     The stage, intended also for vaudeville, depicts an Arabian setting, and is rich with velour hangings
     of a deep wine color, bordered with heavy gold fringe.
     <br />
     <br />
     The magnificent pipe organ purchased through the A. Gressett Music House of Meridian, from the 
     George Kilgen Organ Company of St. Louis, one of the oldest organ concerns in the world, is an 
     amazing instrument, or rather a multitude of instruments that can duplicate any sound that can
     be heard at any symphony concert.  The wonderful volume, range and sweetness of this instrument term 
     it correctly the "Wonder Organ."
     <br /><br />
     Not only will patrons see a temple of entertainment, magnificent to the eye, but they will also find 
     the new theatre equipped with every conceivable device for their comfort, convenience and safety.  An
     iced drinking fountain, a fireproof projection room with automatic shutters, and aisle lights are a 
     few of the modern facilities that place the theatre in the front ranks.
     <br /><br />
     The entire picture house, the last word in architecture, utility and decorative art, is like so many
     of our great theatres, a monument to the artistic conception of Emile Weil, Inc., Architects, New Orleans.
     The work was designed by Mr. Markel of that office, and supervised by Mr. L. W. Duffee, Laurel's home architect.
     <br /><br />
     The decorating was done by Mandel Brothers of Chicago, who decorated the Saenger Theatre in New Orleans,
     a marvelous achievement.  The were ably assisted in their work by the McDevitt Brothers of Laurel, who
     have beautified so many of our Laurel homes and public buildings.
     <br /><br />
     The contractor, who has been so tireless in carrying this $150,000 structure to completion was Mr. C. S. 
     Norman, whose splendid work is evident all over our city.
     <br /><br />
     No one can think of the beauty of the theatre and its generous protrise of pleasure without a feeling
     of appreciation toward those public spirited men, Messrs. W. S. Taylor, known to the show world as 
     'Sank,' Charles Green and B. A. Schneider, who have made such a dream possible.  Their belief in the 
     future of Laurel and their interest in its amusement, have been most beautifully voiced.
     <br /><br />
     Housed within such a triumphant architectural art, the popular manager, Mr. Reuben DeGruy, will be on the
     alert to get the finest of pictures and his gifted and lovely wife will ever be ready with the latest of 
     selections for the organ.

        <span class="showtitle">GORGEOUS ORGAN IS TO BE BIG FEATURE OF 'ARABIAN' BILLS
            <br />in the Laurel Daily Leader&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March 31, 1927
        </span>
    </strong>
    <br /><br />
    An organ "with an imagination," in fact, as fine a theatre organ as any in America, will be heard by the
    patrons of the new Arabian Theatre when that "palace of splendor" opens its doors tomorrow at two o'clock
    in the afternoon.
    <br /><br />
    Manufactured by the Kilgen Organ Company, one of the world's standard makers of theatrical organs,
    this amazing instrument, or rather, combination of a multitude of musical instruments, can duplicate 
    any quality of sound that can be heard at any symphony orchestral concert.
    <br /><br />
    Not only that, but it can also imitate with uncanny accuracy the songs of birds, the roar of jungle beasts,
    the lowing of cows, the barking of dogs, the mewing of cats, and the howls of wolves.
    <br /><br />
    It can honk at you like an auto horn with such realism that the patron will imagine himself in the heart 
    of the city's traffic district.  It can do a foghorn imitation or give forth the sound of fire gongs or 
    cathedral chimes.
    <br /><br />
    Many of the features of the new organ are unique in Laurel.  It will perfectly reproduce a cello, a 
    trumpet, an oboe, clarinet or any stringed instrument.  And, here is news for Laurel:  it was purchased by 
    the Strand Amusement Company only after an exhaustive investigation was made of all other organ manufacturers,
    and the organ selected was constructed and voiced to meet the requirements of the acoustical conditions of 
    the new Arabian Theatre, thereby making it a custom-built pipe organ.
    <br /><br />
    In the bass department is the bombarde, which contains a series of vast pipes.  These pipes register a 
    tone which reaches the limit of sound depth which the human ear can apprehend.
    <br /><br />
    The majestic rumble of the bombarde forms an impressive basis for the lighter tones of the instrument.  
    For not only can the Kilgen organ produce the sweet tones of violin music, it can also replicate a marimba.
    <br /><br />
    The total number of pipes in the organ is 62, and there are numerous instruments of percussion connected
    with it, which gives the organist every musical possibility for the interpretation of the picture.  These 
    include, in addition to those already mentioned, tympani, snare drum,  a bass drum, cymbals and a tom-tom.
    Tambourine and the castanet sounds also are easy for the giant among organs.
    <br /><br />
    Another distinctive feature of the organ is the adjustable combination piston, which permits unlimited
    grouping of tonal colors for use instantaneously by merely pressing a piston, of which there are twenty 
    complete set of couplers; which are at the performer's command, permit magnificent tonal blending.
    <br /><br />
    And yet another outstanding feature is the second touch provided for the accompaniment, solo and pedal
    divisions, by means of which the beautiful counter melodies are produced.  A set of expression controls
    are provided for the organ chamber allowing a crescendo effect from the echo to the most powerful double
    forte.  In addition to these facilities, at the command of the organist, is a balanced crescendo.
    <br /><br />
    A five-horsepower motor will be "the power behind the music."  There is enough wire in the organ to make a
    wire fence seventy-five miles long.Fifteen hundred electro-magnets are also part of the equipment.
    <br /><br />
    The woods used in the construction of this organ are of the finest straight grain sugar pine for the
    pipes, blended with maple and walnut, and for the general construction Alaska spruce is employed.
    For the metal pipes, block tin, pure lead, brass, zinc and special alloys are used.

        <span class="showtitle">W.S. "SANK" TAYLOR PIONEER IN SHOW BUSINESS IN LAUREL
            <br />in the Laurel Daily Leader&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March 31, 1927
        </span>
    </strong>
    <br /><br />
    The very thought of W.S.Taylor, affectionately known to every man, woman and child in Laurel as "Sank,"
    brings a happy smile to everyone because he has mastered the art of success without a trace of antagonism.
    He might be termed our veteran show man, were it not for his youth, for he has ministered to the wants of our
    pleasure-seekers from the year 1907.
    <br /><br />
    His rise to success has been quick and picturesque, and very much in line with the progress of our city 
    itself.  In 1898, he first became a resident of Laurel, coming here from Wayne County, and bringing with
    him that urge to industry which is born of early responsibility.  
    <br /><br />
    With his widowed mother and family, he settled in Laurel, accepting a position as night clerk at the old 
    Laurel Hotel.  His first business venture found him the owner of a fruit stand, and it was in 1907 that 
    he grasped the immense opportunity that the motion picture industry offered.
    <br /><br />
    The first picture presented by our popular theatre magnate was "The Mexican Bull Fight," a one-reel picture
    which had a whole week's run in the building now known as Buck McNeil's Barber Shop.  From this tiny acorn,
    the great oak grew.  A tent show was next and later a Bijou Theatre in the Jim Cross building and finally
    another Bijou where the Electric Service Company new operates.
    <br /><br />
    As Sank grew, so did the movies, and from a one-reel picture run all week, it progressed to two-reel
    pictures three times a week.  The first big picture of three-reels was "The Passion Play," and the next
    "The Man On The Box," which marked the real beginning of Paramount feature pictures.  With this, our genial
    Sank was then showing three reels, three times weekly, which was adjudged a great triumph in those days.
    <br /><br />
    During the history of the rise of our popular townsman, he has been able to outlive and overcome the
    competition of nineteen different competitors engaged in a similar occupation.
    <br /><br />
    On February fifth, 1921, the present Strand Theatre opened its doors, and it looked as if there was
    serious competition for Sank, then operating the old Bijou, but in July of the same year, Sank himself
    was master of the situation, purchasing the controlling interest in the Strand Theatre.  In 1922, Messers. 
    Green and Schneider became part owners with Sank, buying an interest in what has since been known as the 
    Strand Amusement Company.
    <br /><br />
    Outside of the show world, Sank has wholesome tastes, with a love of nature and a love of home.  There is
    something of the eternal boy in him, for he is as much a lover of true sport as any twelve-year-old.  
    He is one of our leading fishermen, and does not have to magnify his fish to make a good story.
    <br /><br />
    All our people are happy to see Sank wearing his laurels and expanding his sphere of achievement through
    the opening of the beautiful new Arabian.

    <br /><br />
    A dominant influence everywhere in Laurel is Mr. Charles Green, lumberman and capitalist.  Not only in the lumber
    world is he a power, but likewise in the amusement world.  He is a lover of sports and high class instruments.
    As one of the triangle that owns the Strand Amusement Company, he has been a great factor of the realization of 
    the new Arabian.  It is by men of such well-balanced nature that the best work is accomplished and the 
    most enduring results are attained.
    <br /><br />
    Mr. Green was born in New Orleans and studied at Tulane University.  He has always taken a keen interest
    in sports and was captain of the varsity team.  He became interested in the banking business in New Orleans
    and remained in that city until 1906, when he established his home in Laurel, where he has since resided.
    He is president of Eastman, Gardiner &amp; Co. as well as serving with other important corporations.  He is 
    a director of the First National Bank and is interested in innumerable other industries.  
    <br /><br />
    For the Arabian to have the backing of a man of his caliber insures us of a wonderful amusement house for all times.

            <br />in the Laurel Daily Leader&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March 31, 1927

    </strong>
    <br /><br />
    One of our leading business successes is Mr. B.A. Schneider, an outstanding figure in Laurel's financial, 
    social and amusement world.  His unerring instinct for sound investments proves beyond a doubt the 
    success of the beautiful new Arabian, in the ownership of which he is one of a trio of Laurel's most 
    substantial business men.  
    <br /><br />
    Unselfish and public spirited always in promoting sport, it seems only fitting that he should have a 
    hand in our new temple of amusement.  His efforts in promoting baseball for Laurel will be recalled
    with special appreciation.
    <br /><br />
    Mr. Schneider's prominence in Laurel manifests itself in many substantial ways.  Next to those who 
    have manufactured lumber, those who have made brick for the foundations of our city have contributed
    much to the building and growth of Laurel.  It was in that business that Mr. Schneider made his mark.

    Mr. L.W. Duffee has been indefatigable in his watchful superintending of the finer parts of the work on the
    Arabian.  He has the composite mind of the scholar and artist and with all the qualities of the careful 
    workman.  He has seen his dream of a playhouse come true in all its perfection.  
    <br /><br />
    Mr. Duffee is an artist not only in the proper massing together of building material, he has likewise an 
    eye for beauty in the open spaces, with a most wonderful ingenuity.  The Arabian has been completed without
    an inch of wasted space and with safety, beauty and utility wonderfully considered.  Laurel is fortunate to 
    posses a man with Mr. Duffee's architectural understanding.

            <br />in the Laurel Daily Leader&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March 31, 1927

    <br /><br />
    Wonderful efficiency and a thorough understanding of the show business belongs to the popular young manager,
    Mr. Reuben DeGruy, who since 1910 has been associated with Mr. Taylor.  
    <br /><br />
    When a mere boy, he swept the sidewalks in front of the theatres and swept them thoroughly, later rising
    to the position of ticket seller, then to operator and later to the present position of manager.  
    His conscientious and careful treatment of even his smallest duty have paved the way for his present 
    success and today he is "the real working power behind the throne, everyone depending upon his good, sound judgment 
    and quick energy.
    <br /><br />
    Since 1910, our efficient manager has been a resident of Laurel, coming here from Gulfport.  He was born in 
    Baton Rouge, La.  In 1922 he was married to Miss Ruth Reddock, an artist and musician whose own talent has 
    been heard in our city for years playing the organ at the Strand 
    Theatre.  She will now take charge of the "Wonder Organ" at the new Arabian Theatre.

            <br />in the Laurel Daily Leader&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March 31, 1927
        </span>
    </strong>
    <br /><br />
    Clara Bow has joined in the select circle enhanced by Thomas Meighan, Adolph Menjou, Florence Vidor, 
    Wallace Beery, Raymond Griffith, Bebe Daniels, Esther Ralston, Douglas MacLean, Pola Negri and Harold 
    Llyod, and is now a Paramount star.  Her first production, adapted from Elinor Glyn's "It", will be the
    feature picture shown on the opening of the new Arabian Theatre.
    <br /><br />
    And if you wonder why Clara has been raised to the starry heights, consider for a moment, the following
    excerpts from New York newspaper reviews when "The Plastic Age" was presented in that city:
    <br /><br />
    "Clara Bow's performances," said The Mirror, "as the fast moving, fast loving, yet sweetly sincere
    youngster is a rollicksome treat.  There is no question about Miss Bow being foremost among those 
    headed for stardom.  Perhaps it is her cheery abandon that vivifies her.  Perhaps it is her riotous
    bobbed locks, expressive eyes, and gamin rakishness.  If she continues to scintillate as she does in
    "The Plastic Age" and as she did last week in her more recent picture, "Mantrap", she strikes us as 
    being the likely successor to Gloria Swanson.  A tall order, perhaps, but we stick to our guns."
    <br /><br />
    "I wonder whether Miss Bow would object to my revealing the secret of it all," wrote a critic on The World.
    "Almost certainly a new and extremely artful method of facial make-up together with lessons in how to order,
    design and wear clothes have done the trick for this strangely appealing miniature brunette vampire.  These
    appurtenances gained, the actress has seemed to turn upon her camera and perform gracefully, confidently
    and with real authority, all of which qualities I had not in this quarter previously detected."
    <br /><br />
    "However that may be, I wish to add my own rich, strong voice to the chorus of critical acclaim in these
    parts.  Miss Bow most assuredly has knocked us over."
    <br /><br />
    "Clara Bow, filmdom's first flapper, gives an excellent performance," said The Graphic. "Somehow we have 
    come to expect it of Clara.  She has ability plus abandon and is one of the the cutest little tricks 
    in pictures."

        <span class="showtitle">THE BEAUTIFUL NEW ARABIAN THEATRE OPENS FRIDAY, APRIL 1ST
            <br />in the Laurel Daily Leader&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March 26, 1927

    <br /><br />
    One of the most attractive features, and one which might escape the casual inspection, is the art and 
    skill that has been combined in the interior decorating in Mississippi's newest and best playhouse.
    <br /><br />
    Planned by the architects to be in keeping with the general "Far Eastern" effect of the entire 
    building, these decorations have been created by one of the most famous firms of interior decorators 
    in the entire country, Mandel Bros., of Chicago, who have just completed all the interior decorations
    in the new $2,500,000 Saenger Theatre in New Orleans.
    <br /><br />
    In the lobby first, then the foyer, and then in the vast expanse of the auditorium itself, as well as all 
    other parts of the theatre, it is hard to realize that all this decorating has been done with infinite care
    and labor BY HAND. Skilled artists have decorated all the vari-colored molding, all the Egyptian symbols
    over the doors, as well as painting of all the beautiful designs on the walls and ceiling of the main 
    auditorium; all of which has been produced slowly, and with painstaking effort by these decorators, just as
    the artist creates the masterpiece one stroke at the time.
    <br /><br />
    It is then that one realizes the efforts that have been made to make the ARABIAN a place of which Laurel 
    may be justly proud.

            <br />in the Laurel Daily Leader&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;August 20, 1930

    <br /><br />
    Laurel--Filling stations outside the city handling tobacco, cigarettes, cigars and soft drinks did a 
    land-office business until their stock of goods ran out Sunday morning, after the late Saturday afternoon 
    edict of Mayor M.W. McLaurin here that all business establishments must close their doors.
    <br /><br />
    Residents and visitors to the city who were caught unaware without their supplies of tobacco, and with a
    cosuming thirst for their favorite soft drinks, were forced to drive from 10 to 30 miles for a 'fag.'
    <br /><br />
    No arrests were recorded Sunday and all concerned in the Sunday closing seemed to be concurring in the
    decision of the mayor.
    <br /><br />
    Motion picture shows kept their doors closed and announced that inasmuch as other establishments and 
    places of amusement were closed they would do likewise.
    <br /><br />
    (A historical note that later in the 1930s it was the movie theatre owners that first fought the
    'blue law' closing rules in Laurel and started the 
    process of reversing those rules.)
