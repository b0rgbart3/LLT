   Our basic ticket sales could never cover all the costs of our productions and the upkeep of 
   our fabulous 1927 Arabian Theatre.  We depend on the kind generosity of all our patrons who
   give above and beyond the basic ticket price to help support our community.
   <br /><br />
   Thanks to all of the patrons listed below - and we'd like to ask that <strong>everyone</strong>
   consider supporting LLT by upgrading to a patron level membership that comes with a few nice perks
   - a free drink (beer, wine or soft drink) at every performance during the year, your listing on both
   our website and in all the show programs, tax deductions, your season tickets - and the new 
   option to select a seat from our 'reserved' patron section.
   <br /><br />
   You can still upgrade a regular season ticket you've already bought up to a patron level.  
   Our membership folks will give you a credit of the regular season ticket amount towards a patron level.
