    Our basic ticket sales could never cover all the costs of our productions and the upkeep of our 
    fabulous 1927 Arabian Theatre.  We depend on the kind generosity of all our patrons who give 
    above and beyond the season ticket price to help support our community.
    <br /><br />
    Thanks to all of the patrons listed below - and we’d like to encourage everyone to consider
    supporting LLT by upgrading to a patron level membership that comes with a few nice perks:<br /><br />
    <ul>
       <li>a complimentary wine or soft drink at each performance you attend</li>
       <li>listing on our website and in all show programs</li>
       <li>tax deductions</li>
       <li>your season tickets</li>
       <li>select a seat from our “gold reserved” patron section</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    You can still upgrade your regular season ticket or single ticket to a patron level season ticket.
    Our membership volunteers will be at the box office at intermission and you can move up to the
    patron level by only paying the difference in the price of your ticket.
    <br /><br />
    Please drop us a line at 
<a style="color:#FFFE12;" <?php echo "href=\"mailto:" . $_SESSION['llt_email'] . "\">" . $_SESSION['llt_email'] . "</a>" ?> 
      if there are any corrections to your listing.
